# Very basic Flask Junior Developer Test for a childish company 

## Objectives

### Primary

- Show a preview of how much the product will cost
- On the confirmation page, generate and display the change from the amount paid 
  with denominations. **For example, £17.40 in change would equal `1 x £10, 1 X £5, 2 x £1, 2 X £0.20`**

### Secondary (if you have time)

- Build a view to list all orders that have been recorded

## Set up

- Get the app running locally:
  - Install requirements in `requirements.txt` (use `pip install -r requirements.txt`), remember to check which version of packages we are using if you are 
    looking for online resources
  - Get flask running by using `python app.py`

## Submitting Code

- Create an appropriate pull request to the main repo with your changes
- Please try and make the project [PEP8](https://pep8.org/) complaint
